## 🎯 YOUR NEW SECTION: "SEE IT IN ACTION"

I added a new section showcasing your creative list screenshot:

**What it shows:**
- Your actual "Top Performing Creatives" grid
- 8 real estate campaigns with real data
- Sorting options visible
- Performance metrics (leads, spend, CPL, CTR)

**Why it's powerful:**
- Proves the tool actually works
- Shows real campaigns (not mockups)
- Demonstrates core value proposition
- Makes visitors think: "I want to see MY creatives ranked like this!"

**Where it is:**
- After the "Features" section
- Before "How It Works"
- Can't miss it - full-width screenshot

## 🎯 EXPECTED RESULTS (90-Day Validation)

Based on your landing page quality:

**Optimistic Scenario:**
- 1,000 visitors → 50-80 signups (5-8%)
- 50-80 trials → 15-25 paying customers (30%)
- 15-25 customers × ₹299 = ₹4,485 - ₹7,475 MRR
- Annual run rate: ₹53K - ₹89K

**Realistic Scenario:**
- 500 visitors → 15-25 signups (3-5%)
- 15-25 trials → 5-10 paying customers (40%)
- 5-10 customers × ₹299 = ₹1,495 - ₹2,990 MRR
- Annual run rate: ₹18K - ₹36K

**Minimum Viable (Your threshold: 15 customers):**
- Need: 15 paying customers
- At 3% signup, 40% conversion = 1,250 visitors needed
- At 5% signup, 40% conversion = 750 visitors needed

**Your decision point:** If <15 customers by Day 90 → Pivot to training or agency upsell
